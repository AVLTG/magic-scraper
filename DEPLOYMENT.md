# Deployment Guide — tabletally

tabletally is an MTG collection checker for friend groups. It lets any member of the group instantly see who owns a given card and which local stores have it in stock. It runs on Next.js (deployed to Vercel) with a Turso (SQLite-compatible) database. Nightly collection syncs are driven by a Vercel Cron job that fetches each user's Moxfield collection automatically.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** — required for local development
- **npm** — comes bundled with Node.js
- **Git** — to clone and push the repository
- **Turso account** (free tier) — https://turso.tech
- **Vercel account** (free Hobby tier) — https://vercel.com
- **Turso CLI** — install via npm or the official docs:
  ```bash
  npm install -g turso
  # or follow: https://docs.turso.tech/cli/installation
  ```

---

## Local Dev Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone <repo-url>
cd tabletally

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create your local env file
cp .env.example .env.local   # then fill in the values below
# If .env.example does not exist, create .env.local manually — see Environment Variables Reference
```

Minimum values needed for local dev (use your Turso dev database URLs or a local dev DB):

```
DATABASE_URL=libsql://your-db-name-your-org.turso.io
DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN=eyJhbGc...
COOKIE_SECRET=<64 hex chars — generate with: openssl rand -hex 32>
ADMIN_PASSWORD=any-admin-password
ALLOW_LEGACY_LOGIN=true
CRON_SECRET=<64 hex chars — generate with: openssl rand -hex 32>
CHROMIUM_REMOTE_EXEC_PATH=https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium/releases/download/v143.0.4/chromium-v143.0.4-pack.x64.tar
```

```bash
# 4. Generate Prisma client (uses libsql adapter)
npx prisma generate

# 5. Apply schema to DB (safe to re-run)
npx prisma db push

# 6. Start dev server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/login` and sign in with a user account — or, while `ALLOW_LEGACY_LOGIN=true`, leave the username blank and enter `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (legacy bootstrap).

> **Note for local scraping:** The Chromium binary is downloaded from `CHROMIUM_REMOTE_EXEC_PATH` at runtime during scraping. This requires an internet connection and may be slow on first use.

---

## Turso Setup

```bash
# Log in to Turso CLI
turso auth login

# Create a new database (name it anything — used only for identification)
turso db create tabletally

# Get the database URL
turso db show tabletally --url
# Output: libsql://tabletally-<your-org>.turso.io
# Copy this — it becomes DATABASE_URL

# Create an auth token (full-access token for the database)
turso db tokens create tabletally
# Output: eyJhbGc...
# Copy this — it becomes DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN
```

Turso free tier includes 500 databases, 9 GB storage, and 1 billion row reads per month — more than enough for this use case.

---

## Vercel Project Setup

1. Go to https://vercel.com/new and import your Git repository
2. Vercel will auto-detect **Next.js** as the framework — no build settings changes are needed
3. Do **not** change the output directory or install command — defaults work correctly
4. Before the first deploy, add all environment variables (see next section)
5. Click **Deploy**

---

## Environment Variables Reference

Set all of these in: **Vercel Dashboard > Project > Settings > Environment Variables**

Apply them to **Production** at minimum. Optionally also set them for Preview and Development environments.

| Variable | What it is | How to get it | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Turso database URL | `turso db show <name> --url` | `libsql://tabletally-myorg.turso.io` |
| `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` | Turso auth token (full access) | `turso db tokens create <name>` | `eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9...` |
| `COOKIE_SECRET` | HMAC key for session cookies — must be 32+ bytes | `openssl rand -hex 32` | `a1b2c3d4...` (64 hex chars) |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Legacy bootstrap password — only works while `ALLOW_LEGACY_LOGIN=true` (see User accounts migration below) | Choose a strong string | `admin-strong-pass-xyz` |
| `ALLOW_LEGACY_LOGIN` | Enables the legacy admin-password login during the user-accounts migration window | `true` / unset | `true` |
| `APP_URL` | Canonical site origin used in generated invite links (falls back to the request origin) | Your production URL | `https://tabletally.example.com` |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Bearer token Vercel sends with cron requests — must match server check | `openssl rand -hex 32` | `f9e8d7c6...` (64 hex chars) |
| `CHROMIUM_REMOTE_EXEC_PATH` | URL to the chromium-min binary tarball used for browser scraping | Copy from releases page | `https://github.com/Sparticuz/chromium/releases/download/v143.0.4/chromium-v143.0.4-pack.x64.tar` |

**Generate secrets locally:**
```bash
# COOKIE_SECRET
openssl rand -hex 32

# CRON_SECRET
openssl rand -hex 32
```

> **Security note:** Never commit `.env.local` to the repository. The `.gitignore` already excludes it.

---

## Database Migration (Production)

Prisma generates the client during the Vercel build step (via `prisma generate` in `postinstall`). However, schema changes must be pushed to the database **before** deploying or **immediately after** if deploying for the first time.

Run this locally against your production Turso database:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="libsql://tabletally-your-org.turso.io" \
DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN="eyJhbGc..." \
npx prisma db push
```

This is safe to re-run — `prisma db push` is idempotent when the schema matches the database.

> **Note:** `prisma migrate deploy` does **not** work with Turso. Use `prisma db push` for schema application. If you need migration scripts, use `prisma migrate diff --script` and run SQL manually via `turso db shell`.

---

## Cron Job Setup

The cron job is already configured in `vercel.json` at the project root:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/sync-collections",
      "schedule": "0 5 */2 * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

Vercel reads this file on every deploy and registers the cron job automatically — **no manual steps required**.

**What it does:** At 5:00 AM UTC (midnight EST) every other day, Vercel calls `/api/cron/sync-collections`, which fetches the latest Moxfield collection data for every user and updates the database.

**Hobby tier timing variance:** On the Vercel Hobby plan, cron jobs are invoked within a ±59 minute window of the scheduled time. The job may run anywhere from 05:00 to 05:59 UTC. This is expected behavior.

**Authentication:** Vercel automatically sends an `Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>` header with each cron invocation. The `CRON_SECRET` env var must be set in Vercel for this to work.

**Verify setup:** After deploying, go to **Vercel Dashboard > Project > Cron Jobs** — the `sync-collections` job should appear with schedule `0 5 */2 * *`.

---

## Fluid Compute

The cron sync function is configured with a 300-second execution budget (`maxDuration = 300`). This requires **Fluid Compute** to be enabled on your Vercel project. Without it, serverless functions default to a 10-second timeout and multi-user collection syncs will time out.

**Enable Fluid Compute:**

1. Go to **Vercel Dashboard > Project > Settings > Functions**
2. Verify that **Fluid Compute** is enabled (it should be on by default for new projects)
3. If it is not enabled, toggle it on and redeploy

> This is the critical step from the known concern in the project docs. Without Fluid Compute, syncing more than 1-2 users will fail with a function timeout.

---

## First Deploy

```bash
# Push to main branch to trigger a Vercel deploy
git push origin main
```

Or trigger manually from **Vercel Dashboard > Deployments > Deploy**.

On first deploy:
1. Vercel installs dependencies and runs `prisma generate` via the build script
2. The app is deployed to `https://<your-project>.vercel.app`
3. The cron job from `vercel.json` is registered automatically

---

## Post-Deploy Verification

Run through this checklist after your first deploy:

- [ ] Visit `https://<your-app>.vercel.app/login` — login page loads
- [ ] Sign in with a user account (or the legacy admin bootstrap) — redirected to the main page
- [ ] Enter the admin password — redirected to `/admin` with admin access
- [ ] Admin panel shows an "Update All Collections" button
- [ ] Click "Update All Collections" — sync runs and returns without error (may take 10-60 seconds per user)
- [ ] Admin panel shows the user list (if users were seeded)
- [ ] Go to **Vercel Dashboard > Project > Cron Jobs** — `sync-collections` is listed with schedule `0 5 */2 * *`
- [ ] (After the next scheduled run) Check **Vercel Dashboard > Project > Logs** — confirm the cron ran and logged user update activity
- [ ] Go to **Vercel Dashboard > Project > Settings > Functions** — confirm Fluid Compute is enabled

---

## Production Schema Updates

Local dev applies schema changes with `prisma db push`. Production Turso needs
manual application — `prisma migrate deploy` is incompatible with the libsql adapter:

```bash
turso db shell <your-db-name> < prisma/migrations-manual/2026-09-05-decks-format-commander-board.sql
turso db shell <your-db-name> < prisma/migrations-manual/2026-09-06-store-health.sql
turso db shell <your-db-name> < prisma/migrations-manual/2026-09-07-deck-mana-data.sql
```

That file adds `decks.format`, `decks.commander`, and `deck_cards.board`
(default `'main'`, existing rows backfilled). Re-running it is safe — the only
errors on retry are benign "duplicate column name" notices.

---

## Seed Users

After the first deploy, add your group members through the admin panel:

1. Visit `https://<your-app>.vercel.app/admin` and log in with the admin password
2. Use the **Add User** form to add each group member:
   - **Name:** Their display name (e.g., "Alice")
   - **Moxfield Collection ID:** The alphanumeric ID from their Moxfield collection URL
3. Click **Update All Collections** to run an initial sync for all users

**How to find a Moxfield Collection ID:**

Go to the user's Moxfield collection page:
```
https://www.moxfield.com/collection/<COLLECTION_ID>
```
The `COLLECTION_ID` is the alphanumeric string at the end of the URL. Copy that value into the Add User form.

> **Note:** Each Moxfield Collection ID must be unique. If you see a `P2002` error when adding a user, the Collection ID is already registered to another user.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Cron shows green in Vercel dashboard but collection data is not updating**
- Check that `CRON_SECRET` in Vercel env vars matches exactly — no extra spaces or newlines
- Check Vercel Logs for the cron invocation to see any runtime errors
- Verify the proxy exclusion is in place: `/api/cron` routes should bypass any middleware auth checks

**Function timeout during sync**
- Enable Fluid Compute (see [Fluid Compute](#fluid-compute) section above)
- The cron route has `maxDuration = 300` — this only takes effect with Fluid Compute enabled

**`P2002` error when adding a user in the admin panel**
- The Moxfield Collection ID is already registered to another user
- Check the user list for a duplicate and remove the old entry first

**Login not working (group or admin password rejected)**
- Verify `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (and `ALLOW_LEGACY_LOGIN`, during the migration window) are set correctly in Vercel env vars
- Verify `COOKIE_SECRET` is set — without it, session cookies cannot be signed and auth will fail
- After changing env vars, redeploy (Vercel does not hot-reload env changes)

**`DATABASE_URL` or `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` errors**
- Verify the Turso database URL format: `libsql://dbname-orgname.turso.io` (not `https://`)
- Turso tokens expire by default — create a new token if needed: `turso db tokens create <name>`

**Build fails with Prisma errors**
- Run `npx prisma generate` locally and commit any generated files if needed
- Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set in Vercel env vars before the build runs

---

## Develop / Staging Environment

The `develop` branch auto-deploys to a Vercel Preview at
`https://magic-scraper-git-develop-avltgs-projects.vercel.app` — an isolated
staging mirror for in-progress work (issue #5 + its sub-issues) that never
touches production:

- **Database**: a fork of prod, `tabletally-dev`
  (`turso db create tabletally-dev --from-db tabletally`). Branch-scoped
  `DATABASE_URL` / `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN` Preview env vars point `develop` at the
  fork, so migrations run on `develop` never alter production data.
- **Secrets**: `COOKIE_SECRET`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `CRON_SECRET`
  are inherited from the shared Preview scope (same login as prod).
- **Discord**: disabled on `develop` (placeholder `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`) so test
  games don't post to the real channel.
- **Cron**: Vercel Cron runs on **production only** — `develop` does not
  nightly-sync. Use the admin "Update Collections" button to refresh
  `tabletally-dev` on demand.

Every push to `develop` triggers a fresh preview build. To reset the staging
data back to a copy of production, drop and re-fork:
`turso db destroy tabletally-dev && turso db create tabletally-dev --from-db tabletally`
(then re-mint the token and update the branch-scoped `DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN`).

---

## User Accounts Migration (issue #6)

Shared group-password auth is replaced by per-user accounts created only via
admin invites. `GROUP_PASSWORD` is retired entirely; `ADMIN_PASSWORD` survives
only as an env-gated bootstrap.

### Rollout order (staging first, then production)

1. Apply the schema (adds nullable auth columns on `users` + the `invites`
   table; existing users/collections are preserved):
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="libsql://..." DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN="..." npx prisma db push
   ```
2. Set `ALLOW_LEGACY_LOGIN=true` (and optionally `APP_URL`) in Vercel env vars
   and deploy the branch.
3. Log in with the legacy admin password — **leave the username field blank**
   on `/login` and enter `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
4. In **/admin → Invites**: create a *bound* invite for your own collection
   user with **Admin account** checked, click **Open now (self-assign)**, and
   set your password. You now have a real ADMIN account.
5. Send invites to the group (bound invites for existing collection users —
   their username is locked to a slug of their name; open invites for anyone
   else). The group password no longer works anywhere.
6. Once everyone has an account: set `ALLOW_LEGACY_LOGIN=false` (or delete the
   var) and redeploy. `GROUP_PASSWORD` can be deleted; keep `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   only if you may need to re-bootstrap.

### Notes

- Passwords are hashed with scrypt (`node:crypto`) in Node API routes only —
  the Edge middleware never touches password hashing.
- Sessions are HMAC-signed `session` cookies carrying `userId` + `role`; the
  old `admin_session` cookie is gone (middleware checks `role === 'ADMIN'`).
  Everyone is logged out once after deploy (old cookie format is rejected).
- Invite links are single-use, expire after 7 days by default (max 30), and
  are shown exactly once at creation — only a SHA-256 hash is stored.
- Revoking an invite hard-deletes it (no audit trail) — accepted tradeoff for
  a private app.
- Nightly sync skips login-only users with no `moxfieldCollectionId`.
- Password reset: no self-service flow — delete the user's `username`/
  `passwordHash` … or simpler, have the admin create a new *bound* invite once
  the username is cleared. (Tracked as future work.)

## Decks & Card Library Migration (issue #7)

One additive migration (`add_decks_and_card_library`) plus a one-time backfill script.
No new environment variables — Scryfall's API is keyless.

1. **Apply the migration** (same Turso procedure as issue #6 — prisma's CLI rejects
   libsql URLs, so generate SQL and pipe it through the Turso shell):
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate diff --from-url "file:./prod-snapshot.db" \
     --to-schema-datamodel prisma/schema.prisma --script > /tmp/decks-migration.sql
   # review the SQL, then:
   turso db shell tabletally < /tmp/decks-migration.sql
   ```
   The migration is additive (new `decks`/`deck_cards` tables, new
   `collection_cards.source` column defaulting to `'moxfield'`) — no data loss.

2. **Run the legacy deck backfill** (idempotent; creates a Deck per distinct
   historical deckName, owned by the user who played it most). Run it with
   `node` — Node ≥22.18 strips the TypeScript natively (the script's `.ts`
   import extensions are deliberate for this); `npx tsx ...` works too:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="libsql://<db>.turso.io" DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN="<token>" \
     node src/scripts/backfillDecks.ts
   ```
   Review the printed deck→owner table; fix stragglers in Admin → Decks.

3. Nightly sync now only replaces `source='moxfield'` rows — manually added
   library cards survive automatically.
